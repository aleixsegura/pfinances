"""
Export Revolut cash balances (current + savings) and crypto holdings to
data/revolut.json.

Revolut has no personal API, so this drives the Revolut web app
(https://app.revolut.com) with Playwright and a persistent browser profile,
capturing the app's own internal retail JSON API responses off the network —
no DOM scraping.

First run (or whenever the session expires):
  python3 export_revolut.py --login
opens a headed browser; log in with your phone number + passcode and approve
the push notification in the Revolut phone app. The session persists in
.revolut-profile/ (gitignored), so later runs work headlessly:
  python3 export_revolut.py

Besides balances, the EUR current account's full transaction history and the
Boosted (savings) account's daily interest are exported to
data/revolut_transactions.json — see write_transactions.

Balances arrive in minor units (cents, satoshis) and are converted with
Coinbase's public spot API, which also quotes fiat pairs. Every position and
pocket is normalized to EUR (the portfolio's base currency); crypto positions
additionally carry `lastPrice` in USD, the currency crypto is conventionally
quoted in.

If the export stops finding data, Revolut likely changed their internal API:
rerun with --debug (dumps every retail API response to .revolut-debug/) and
update CAPTURE_PATTERNS / ROUTES below.

# `groupKey` and even an `id`; only `legId` tells them apart. The shapes that
# matter, all with a `state` that is CANCELLED for orders that never filled:
#
#   REVX_EXCHANGE  a Revolut X trade. The fiat leg carries the gross amount and
#                  the fee; the crypto leg's `counterpart.amount` is the *net*
#                  proceeds, which is why the fiat leg is the one read here —
#                  tax law wants the gross and the fee apart, not netted.
#   TOPUP          coins arriving from an outside wallet (the Bybit transfer).
#                  Moving your own coins is not an acquisition, so this is
#                  recorded as a deposit: the cost basis stays with the
#                  original purchase, wherever that was.
#   REWARD         a staking payout, credited in the STAKING pocket.
#   TRANSFER       internal staking/unstaking moves — no tax event.
#   REVX_TRANSFER  fiat shuffling between the current and Revolut X accounts.
#
# Anything unrecognised is counted in `ignoredTypes` rather than dropped in
# silence, so a shape change shows up as a number instead of a missing sale.
